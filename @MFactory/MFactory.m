classdef MFactory < handle
    % Builds models in a multistage process
    % 1) Make an empty MFactory object and call addPolicy to add
    %    rules used to construct mixers. The rules specify operator
    %    sp (hybrid, sonly, ponly) and atom types (iatom for diagonal,
    %    iatom and jatom for off diagonal). The input to this function is
    %    varargin, with 'key','value' pairs. the possible keys and their
    %    values are specified in the verify* methods called at the start of
    %    the addPolicy method.
    % 2) Call MFactory.makeMixInfo(atomtypes) to create mixInfo{} which
    %    holds all mixers that may be needed for the given set of
    %    atomtypes. mixInfo includes both the mixer and the information
    %    regarding how that mixer should be added to models. (Note that
    %    MSet has a method "atomTypes" that returns all atom times in a
    %    given set of models. 
    % 3) Call MFactory.makeFitme(MSet) to creat a fitme object that
    %    contains all of the models in MSet. makeFitme: adds the models,
    %    call Fitme.setEnv() to calculate all of the highlevel results
    %    against which to fit, and creates a CSet object that has all of
    %    the needed contexts. (The context variables depend on both mixer
    %    and model, which is why this is handled here.)
    % The motivation for this three stage building is that stage 1 handles
    % the decisions (how is each operator being handled for each atom
    % type). In some cases, a decision may need to generate many mixers, so
    % it would not be good to handle these decisions through specific
    % mixers.
    % Stage 2 implements those decisions for a particular set of atom
    % types. This includes making the mixers, and since the mixers hold the
    % paramters, the mixers are actually functions of both the policies and
    % the training data. At the end of stage 2, you essentially have an
    % object that you can train on any set of data.
    % Stage 3 applies the current state of mixers to a set of models to
    % make a fitme object. To begin, you would make a fitme object based on
    % the training data, and then do a fit of the parameters. Once these
    % parameters are established, additional calls to makefitme can be used
    % to apply those trained parameters to any set of models.
